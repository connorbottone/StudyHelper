# StudyHelper

## Description

This application is used to create and take quizzes that are made by users, primarily focused towards parents and educators to use in order to teach students in varying grade levels. Also, our application can be directly used by students to use as a studytool as well. When users sign up for an account, they will then be given access to create and take quizzes. Otherwise, they would be redirected to a sign up form to create an account and log in. Users can create quizzes with the criteria of grade level, subject, the amount of questions that they would like for the quiz, and a short description of the quizzes as well. We have also implemented a report quiz function, as our application is directed towards students, and making sure that they are protected from bad actors and anything that may be harmful to them is our main priority. This educational tool is meant to be customizable and geared towards the personal and specific learning method of a given student. Our goal was to make this application as user friendly as possible, so that our users can have an easy understanding of navigating through our website and creating the specific quizzes that they would like.

Our group decided to create this application, as we feel that it is very relevant towards the education space and provides the users with a very personal tool to help different students who have different needs. Also, many of our group members have educators within our family, and feel that our application could potentially be very useful to them in helping their students learn. Our simple webpage functionality allows anyone to create an account on our site and create/take quizzes without a complicated UI. Creating this project allowed our group to practice the different concepts that we have learned in this section, and apply it to a real world application. We were also able to get more experience in collaborating with a team in order to meet our end goal.

## Usage

When opening our web application, we are presented with a homepage that contains a navbar that displays our title, a login button, and a sign up button. Our homepage displays two cards, one for exploring different quizzes, and another to create a quiz. When going into the sign up page, the user is prompted for their username, email, and password in order to create an account. When users are finished creating an account, they are then redirected to the homepage, with authentication to use the different functionality within our application. The navbar is also updated with the user profile and a logout functionality. When going into the courses page, the user is shown the different grade levels that are available. When choosing a grade level, the user can then choose the subject that they would like to use for the quiz. When going into the create quiz page, users are prompted with a form to create their personalized quiz.
